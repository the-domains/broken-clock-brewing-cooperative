# WHAT IS BROKEN CLOCK BREWING COOPERATIVE?

**Broken Clock **is a brewery cooperative slated to become a brewpub, brew farm, and event center based in Minnesota's Twin Cities (Minneapolis/St. Paul). We believe that brewing great beer will help us achieve something greater for our community and our environment. Currently, all member-owners are Minnesota residents, and all member-owners own equal stakes in the company.[We share the common vision][0] of making this venture a meaningful and exciting experience that no other brewery will be able to provide.

At Broken Clock Brewing, we believe that being a brew cooperative is bigger than just brewing great beer. We aspire to make a difference by empowering people, inspiring passion, and fostering collaboration in our community. Being a cooperative means that we put the needs of the community ahead of the bottom line. We make our decisions based not on what is acceptable or easy, but by what builds a stronger community and a better world. Every member of Broken Clock Brewing is more than just a shareholder, they are an integral part of our community of change. Here at Broken Clock Brewing, we are changing the world one pint at a time.
